                <h2>NSS(National Service Scheme)</h2>
                <p>My journey with the National Service Scheme (NSS)has been incredibly fulfiling and transformative. I am attend the NSS camp.As a member,I engaged in various community service projects that allowed me to contribute meaningfully to society.</p>

                <p> NSS volunteers generally work in villages, slums and voluntary agencies to complete 120 hours of regular activities during an academic year. As per the fundamental principles of National Service Scheme, a volunteer is expected to remain in constant touch with the community. Hence, it is of vital importance that a particular village/slum is selected for implementation of NSS programmes. 
.</p>
                    
                    <p>As the NSS volunteer is to live with the members of the community during the 7 days Special Camping Programme and learn from their experience during his/her tenure in NSS, the village/slum should be carefully selected for adoption by NSS unit.</p>
